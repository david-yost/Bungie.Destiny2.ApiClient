# Org.OpenAPITools.Model.DestinyComponentsProfilesDestinyProfileTransitoryTrackingEntry
This represents a single \"thing\" being tracked by the player.  This can point to many types of entities, but only a subset of them will actually have a valid hash identifier for whatever it is being pointed to.  It's up to you to interpret what it means when various combinations of these entries have values being tracked.

## Properties

**TrackedDate** | **DateTime?** | OPTIONAL - I&#39;ve got to level with you, I don&#39;t really know what this is. Is it when you started tracking it? Is it only populated for tracked items that have time limits?  I don&#39;t know, but we can get at it - when I get time to actually test what it is, I&#39;ll update this. In the meantime, bask in the mysterious data. | [optional]
