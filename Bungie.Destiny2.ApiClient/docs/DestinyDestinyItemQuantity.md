# Org.OpenAPITools.Model.DestinyDestinyItemQuantity
Used in a number of Destiny contracts to return data about an item stack and its quantity. Can optionally return an itemInstanceId if the item is instanced - in which case, the quantity returned will be 1. If it's not... uh, let me know okay? Thanks.
