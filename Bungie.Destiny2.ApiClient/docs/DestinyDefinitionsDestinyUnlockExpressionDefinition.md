# Org.OpenAPITools.Model.DestinyDefinitionsDestinyUnlockExpressionDefinition
Where the sausage gets made. Unlock Expressions are the foundation of the game's gating mechanics and investment-related restrictions. They can test Unlock Flags and Unlock Values for certain states, using a sufficient amount of logical operators such that unlock expressions are effectively Turing complete.  Use UnlockExpressionParser to evaluate expressions using an IUnlockContext parsed from Babel.
