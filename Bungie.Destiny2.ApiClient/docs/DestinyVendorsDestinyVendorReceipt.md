# Org.OpenAPITools.Model.DestinyVendorsDestinyVendorReceipt
If a character purchased an item that is refundable, a Vendor Receipt will be created on the user's Destiny Profile. These expire after a configurable period of time, but until then can be used to get refunds on items. BNet does not provide the ability to refund a purchase *yet*, but you know.
