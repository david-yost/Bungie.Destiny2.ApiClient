# Org.OpenAPITools.Model.DestinyCharacterDestinyCharacterCustomization
Raw data about the customization options chosen for a character's face and appearance.  You can look up the relevant class/race/gender combo in DestinyCharacterCustomizationOptionDefinition for the character, and then look up these values within the CustomizationOptions found to pull some data about their choices. Warning: not all of that data is meaningful. Some data has useful icons. Others have nothing, and are only meant for 3D rendering purposes (which we sadly do not expose yet)
