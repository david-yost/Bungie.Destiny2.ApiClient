# Org.OpenAPITools.Model.DestinyDestinyStatAggregationType
When a Stat (DestinyStatDefinition) is aggregated, this is the rules used for determining the level and formula used for aggregation.  * CharacterAverage = apply a weighted average using the related DestinyStatGroupDefinition on the DestinyInventoryItemDefinition across the character's equipped items. See both of those definitions for details. * Character = don't aggregate: the stat should be located and used directly on the character. * Item = don't aggregate: the stat should be located and used directly on the item.
