# Org.OpenAPITools.Model.DestinyMilestonesDestinyMilestoneActivityPhase
Represents whatever information we can return about an explicit phase in an activity. In the future, I hope we'll have more than just \"guh, you done gone and did something,\" but for the forseeable future that's all we've got. I'm making it more than just a list of booleans out of that overly-optimistic hope.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Complete** | **bool** | Indicates if the phase has been completed. | [optional] 
**PhaseHash** | **int** | In DestinyActivityDefinition, if the activity has phases, there will be a set of phases defined in the \&quot;insertionPoints\&quot; property. This is the hash that maps to that phase. | [optional]
