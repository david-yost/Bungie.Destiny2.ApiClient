# Org.OpenAPITools.Model.DestinyMilestonesDestinyPublicMilestone
Information about milestones, presented in a character state-agnostic manner. Combine this data with DestinyMilestoneDefinition to get a full picture of the milestone, which is basically a checklist of things to do in the game. Think of this as GetPublicAdvisors 3.0, for those who used the Destiny 1 API.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**MilestoneHash** | **int** | The hash identifier for the milestone. Use it to look up the DestinyMilestoneDefinition for static data about the Milestone. | [optional] 
**AvailableQuests** | [**List&lt;DestinyMilestonesDestinyPublicMilestoneQuest&gt;**](DestinyMilestonesDestinyPublicMilestoneQuest.md) | A milestone not need have even a single quest, but if there are active quests they will be returned here. | [optional] 
**Activities** | [**List&lt;DestinyMilestonesDestinyPublicMilestoneChallengeActivity&gt;**](DestinyMilestonesDestinyPublicMilestoneChallengeActivity.md) |  | [optional] 
**VendorHashes** | **List&lt;int&gt;** | Sometimes milestones - or activities active in milestones - will have relevant vendors. These are the vendors that are currently relevant.  Deprecated, already, for the sake of the new \&quot;vendors\&quot; property that has more data. What was I thinking. | [optional] 
**Vendors** | [**List&lt;DestinyMilestonesDestinyPublicMilestoneVendor&gt;**](DestinyMilestonesDestinyPublicMilestoneVendor.md) | This is why we can&#39;t have nice things. This is the ordered list of vendors to be shown that relate to this milestone, potentially along with other interesting data. | [optional] 
**StartDate** | **DateTime?** | If known, this is the date when the Milestone started/became active. | [optional] 
**EndDate** | **DateTime?** | If known, this is the date when the Milestone will expire/recycle/end. | [optional] 
**Order** | **int** | Used for ordering milestones in a display to match how we order them in BNet. May pull from static data, or possibly in the future from dynamic information. | [optional]
