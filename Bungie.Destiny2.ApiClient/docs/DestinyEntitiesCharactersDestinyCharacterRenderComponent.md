# Org.OpenAPITools.Model.DestinyEntitiesCharactersDestinyCharacterRenderComponent
Only really useful if you're attempting to render the character's current appearance in 3D, this returns a bare minimum of information, pre-aggregated, that you'll need to perform that rendering. Note that you need to combine this with other 3D assets and data from our servers.  Examine the Javascript returned by https://bungie.net/sharedbundle/spasm to see how we use this data, but be warned: the rabbit hole goes pretty deep.
