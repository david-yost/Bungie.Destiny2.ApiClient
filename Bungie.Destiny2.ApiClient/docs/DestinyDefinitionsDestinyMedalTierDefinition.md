# Org.OpenAPITools.Model.DestinyDefinitionsDestinyMedalTierDefinition
An artificial construct of our own creation, to try and put some order on top of Medals and keep them from being one giant, unmanageable and unsorted blob of stats.  Unfortunately, we haven't had time to do this evaluation yet in Destiny 2, so we're short on Medal Tiers. This will hopefully be updated over time, if Medals continue to exist.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**TierName** | **string** | The name of the tier. | [optional] 
**Order** | **int** | If you&#39;re rendering medals by tier, render them in this order (ascending) | [optional] 
**Hash** | **int** | The unique identifier for this entity. Guaranteed to be unique for the type of entity, but not globally.  When entities refer to each other in Destiny content, it is this hash that they are referring to. | [optional] 
**Index** | **int** | The index of the entity as it was found in the investment tables. | [optional] 
**Redacted** | **bool** | If this is true, then there is an entity with this identifier/type combination, but BNet is not yet allowed to show it. Sorry! | [optional]
